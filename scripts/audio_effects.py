AUDIO EFFECTS MODULE
--------------------
Functions for creating audio mashups and applying various effects.

This module provides beginner-friendly functions to create audio mashups by
combining different audio effects. It's perfect for learning how to manipulate
audio and create interesting sound combinations.

Key Concepts for Beginners:
- Audio Mashup: Combining different audio segments with various effects
- Time Stretching: Making audio faster or slower without changing pitch
- Pitch Shifting: Changing the pitch (high/low) without changing speed
- Echo Effect: Adding delayed copies of the audio for a "reverb" sound
- Audio Normalization: Making sure audio doesn't get too loud and distort

    Create a mashup of audio segments with different effects.
    
    This function takes an audio file and creates a creative mashup by:
    1. Splitting the audio into 5 equal segments
    2. Applying different effects to each segment
    3. Combining them back together to create a unique sound
    
    Effects applied:
    - Segment 1: Original (no changes)
    - Segment 2: Speed up (1.5x faster)
    - Segment 3: Pitch shift (higher pitch)
    - Segment 4: Reversed (played backwards)
    - Segment 5: Echo effect (with multiple delayed copies)
    
    Args:
        audio_path (str): Path to the audio file (used if y and sr are None)
        output_dir (str): Directory to save output file
        y (np.array, optional): Audio data (if you already have it loaded)
        sr (int, optional): Sample rate (if you already have it loaded)
        save (bool): Whether to save the output file
        
    Returns:
        np.array: The mashup audio data
