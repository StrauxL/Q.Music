AUDIO INFO MODULE
-----------------
Functions for analyzing and displaying audio file information.

This module provides beginner-friendly functions to get basic information about
audio files and visualize them. It's perfect for understanding what's in your
audio files before processing them.

Key Concepts for Beginners:
- Sample Rate: How many audio samples per second (usually 44100 Hz)
- Duration: How long the audio is in seconds
- Waveform: Visual representation of the audio's amplitude over time
- Spectrogram: Visual representation of frequencies over time
- Amplitude: How loud the audio is at any given moment

# Import necessary libraries for audio processing and visualization
import librosa             # Main audio processing library
import librosa.display     # For audio visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # For creating plots and graphs
import numpy as np         # For numerical operations and arrays

    Display basic information about the audio file and visualize waveform and spectrogram.
    
    This function is perfect for beginners who want to understand what's in their audio files.
    It loads an audio file, shows basic information about it, and creates two helpful
    visualizations: a waveform and a spectrogram.
    
    What it shows:
    1. Basic file information (sample rate, duration, number of samples)
    2. Waveform: Shows the audio's amplitude (loudness) over time
    3. Spectrogram: Shows which frequencies are present over time
    
    Args:
        audio_path (str): Path to the audio file (e.g., "song.mp3", "audio.wav")
        
    Returns:
        tuple: Audio data (y) and sample rate (sr)
            - y: The actual audio samples as a numpy array
            - sr: Sample rate (samples per second, usually 44100)

        # Step 1: Load the audio file
        # librosa.load() automatically converts to mono and resamples to 22050 Hz by default
        # It returns two things: the audio data (y) and sample rate (sr)
        y, sr = librosa.load(audio_path)

        # Step 2: Calculate and display basic information

        # Colors represent intensity: brighter = louder at that frequency
        plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)  # Create second subplot (2 rows, 1 column, position 2)
